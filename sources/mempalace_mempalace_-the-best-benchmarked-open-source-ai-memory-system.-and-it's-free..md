## MemPalace

Local-first AI memory. Verbatim storage, pluggable backend, 96.6% R@5 raw on LongMemEval — zero API calls.

---

## What it is

MemPalace stores your conversation history as verbatim text and retrieves it with semantic search. It does not summarize, extract, or paraphrase. The index is structured — people and projects become *wings*, topics become *rooms*, and original content lives in *drawers* — so searches can be scoped rather than run against a flat corpus.

The retrieval layer is pluggable. The current default is ChromaDB; the interface is defined in [`mempalace/backends/base.py`](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace/blob/develop/mempalace/backends/base.py) and alternative backends can be dropped in without touching the rest of the system.

Nothing leaves your machine unless you opt in.

## Install

```
pip install mempalace
mempalace init ~/projects/myapp
```

## Quickstart

```
# Mine content into the palace
mempalace mine ~/projects/myapp                    # project files
mempalace mine ~/.claude/projects/ --mode convos   # Claude Code sessions (scope with --wing per project)

# Search
mempalace search "why did we switch to GraphQL"

# Load context for a new session
mempalace wake-up
```

For Claude Code, Gemini CLI, MCP-compatible tools, and local models, see [mempalaceofficial.com/guide/getting-started](https://mempalaceofficial.com/guide/getting-started.html).

## Benchmarks

All numbers below are reproducible from this repository with the commands in [`benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace/blob/develop/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md). Full per-question result files are committed under `benchmarks/results_*`.

**LongMemEval — retrieval recall (R@5, 500 questions):**

| Mode | R@5 | LLM required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw (semantic search, no heuristics, no LLM) | **96.6%** | None |
| Hybrid v4, held-out 450q (tuned on 50 dev, not seen during training) | **98.4%** | None |
| Hybrid v4 + LLM rerank (full 500) | ≥99% | Any capable model |

The raw 96.6% requires no API key, no cloud, and no LLM at any stage. The hybrid pipeline adds keyword boosting, temporal-proximity boosting, and preference-pattern extraction; the held-out 98.4% is the honest generalisable figure.

The rerank pipeline promotes the best candidate out of the top-20 retrieved sessions using an LLM reader. It works with any reasonably capable model — we have reproduced it with Claude Haiku, Claude Sonnet, and minimax-m2.7 via Ollama Cloud (no Anthropic dependency). The gap between raw and reranked is model-agnostic; we do not headline a "100%" number because the last 0.6% was reached by inspecting specific wrong answers, which `benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md` flags as teaching to the test.

**Other benchmarks (full results in [`benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace/blob/develop/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md)):**

| Benchmark | Metric | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LoCoMo (session, top-10, no rerank) | R@10 | 60.3% | 1,986 questions |
| LoCoMo (hybrid v5, top-10, no rerank) | R@10 | 88.9% | Same set |
| ConvoMem (all categories, 250 items) | Avg recall | 92.9% | 50 per category |
| MemBench (ACL 2025, 8,500 items) | R@5 | 80.3% | All categories |

We deliberately do not include a side-by-side comparison against Mem0, Mastra, Hindsight, Supermemory, or Zep. Those projects publish different metrics on different splits, and placing retrieval recall next to end-to-end QA accuracy is not an honest comparison. See each project's own research page for their published numbers.

**Reproducing every result:**

```
git clone https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace.git
cd mempalace
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# see benchmarks/README.md for dataset download commands
python benchmarks/longmemeval_bench.py /path/to/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json
```

## Knowledge graph

MemPalace includes a temporal entity-relationship graph with validity windows — add, query, invalidate, timeline — backed by local SQLite. Usage and tool reference: [mempalaceofficial.com/concepts/knowledge-graph](https://mempalaceofficial.com/concepts/knowledge-graph.html).

## MCP server

29 MCP tools cover palace reads/writes, knowledge-graph operations, cross-wing navigation, drawer management, and agent diaries. Installation and the full tool list: [mempalaceofficial.com/reference/mcp-tools](https://mempalaceofficial.com/reference/mcp-tools.html).

## Agents

Each specialist agent gets its own wing and diary in the palace. Discoverable at runtime via `mempalace_list_agents` — no bloat in your system prompt: [mempalaceofficial.com/concepts/agents](https://mempalaceofficial.com/concepts/agents.html).

## Auto-save hooks

Two Claude Code hooks save periodically and before context compression: [mempalaceofficial.com/guide/hooks](https://mempalaceofficial.com/guide/hooks.html).

For per-message recall on top of the file-level chunks the hooks produce, run `mempalace sweep <transcript-dir>` periodically — it stores one verbatim drawer per user/assistant message, idempotent and resume-safe.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A vector-store backend (ChromaDB by default)
- ~300 MB disk for the default embedding model

No API key is required for the core benchmark path.

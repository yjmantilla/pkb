Checkout our [HuggingFace🤗 collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-speech) for the latest open weight checkpoints and demos!

## Updates

> The first release of NeMo Speech after NeMo repository split is scheduled for June 2026, as the repo undergoes transformation. For the latest stable released version, please use [the 26.02 NGC container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo?version=26.02).

- 2026-04: [Parakeet-unified-en-0.6b](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-unified-en-0.6b) has been released with high-quality offline and streaming (with a minimum latency of 160ms) inference in one model for English language with punctuation and capitalization support.
- 2026-03: [Nemotron 3 VoiceChat](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-voicechat/modelcard) is now released in Early Access. Built on the Nemotron Nano v2 LLM backbone with Nemotron speech and TTS decoder, VoiceChat delivers full-duplex, natural, interruptible conversations with low latency. Try out [the demo](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-voicechat) and apply for [early access](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron-voicechat-early-access).
- 2026-03: [Nemotron-Speech-Streaming v2603](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b) has been updated. It has been trained on a larger and more diverse corpus, resulting in lower WER across all latency modes. Try out [the demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b) and check out [the NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-asr-streaming).
- 2026-03: [MagpieTTS v2602](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m) has been released with support for 9 languages(En, Es, De, Fr, Vi, It, Zh, Hi, Ja). Try out [the demo](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/magpie_tts_multilingual_357m) and check out [the NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual).
- 2026-01: Nemotron-Speech-Streaming was released: One checkpoint that enables users to pick their optimal point on the latency-accuracy Pareto curve!
- 2026-01: MagpieTTS was released.
- 2026: This repo has pivoted to focus on audio, speech, and multimodal LLM. For the last NeMo release with support for more modalities, see [v2.7.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo/releases/tag/v2.7.0)
- 2025-08: [Parakeet V3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3) and [Canary V2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-1b-v2) have been released with speech recognition and translation support for 25 European languages.
- 2025-06: [Canary-Qwen-2.5B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-qwen-2.5b) has been released with record-setting 5.63% WER on English Open ASR Leaderboard.

## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo Speech is built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Speech models including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Speech LLMs. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and deploy new AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the [NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/speech/nightly/).

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or above
- Pytorch 2.6 or above
- NVIDIA GPU (if you intend to do model training)

As of [Pytorch 2.6](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html#torch-load-with-weights-only-true), `torch.load` defaults to using `weights_only=True`. Some model checkpoints may require using `weights_only=False`. In this case, you can set the env var `TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1` before running code that uses `torch.load`. However, this should only be done with trusted files. Loading files from untrusted sources with more than weights only can have the risk of arbitrary code execution.

## Create beautiful slide decks using an intuitive Markdown experience

Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document.

# How to write slides
Split pages by horizontal ruler (\`---\`). It's very simple! :satisfied:

## Based on CommonMark

If you know how to write a document with Markdown, you already know how to write a Marp slide deck. Marp's format is based on [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a consistent Markdown specification. The only important difference is [a ruler `---` for splitting pages.](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown)

## Directives and extended syntax

Sometimes simple text content isn't enough to emphasize your voice, so Marp supports a variety of [directives](https://marpit.marp.app/directives) and extended syntax ([image syntax](https://marpit.marp.app/image-syntax), [math typesetting](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#math-typesetting), [auto-scaling](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core#auto-scaling-features), etc...) to create beautiful slides.

## Built-in themes and CSS theming

[Our core engine](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/) has [3 built-in themes called `default`, `gaia`, and `uncover`](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/tree/main/themes), to tell your story beautifully. If you'd rather customize your design, you can use Marp to [tweak styles with Markdown](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css?id=tweak-style-through-markdown), or [create your own Marp theme with plain CSS](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css).

## Export to HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint

Have you finished writing? It's time to share your deck! Marp can convert Markdown into presentation-ready HTML, PDF and PowerPoint files directly! (Powered by [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) / [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home))

## Marp family: The official toolset

The Marp ecosystem contains a rich toolset to assist your work. [**Marp for VS Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) is an extension that allows you to edit and preview slide Markdown and custom theming within VS Code. [**Marp CLI**](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/) is a command line tool allows you to convert Markdown with a simple CLI interface. [... and much more!](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/)

## Pluggable architecture

As a matter of fact, *Marp is essentially just a converter for Markdown.* The Marp ecosystem is built on [**the Marpit framework**](https://marpit.marp.app/), a skinny framework for creating HTML/CSS slide decks. It has a pluggable architecture and any developer can [extend features via plugins](https://marpit.marp.app/usage?id=extend-marpit-by-plugins).

## Fully open-source

The Marp team loves open source! All tools and related libraries are built by [the Marp team](https://github.com/marp-team) and are MIT-licensed.
